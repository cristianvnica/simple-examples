      <p>
        Here are some essential Git commands examples to help you get started with Git:
      </p>
      <h2>Initialize a new Git repository</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git init</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git init'</strong> initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory by creating a `.git` folder containing the necessary metadata for version control.</p>

      <h2>Clone an existing Git repository</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git clone'</strong> is a command that creates a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine. It downloads the entire repository, including all branches, commit history, and configuration files, allowing you to work on the project locally and keep it in sync with the remote repository.</p>

      <h2>Check the status of your local repository</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git status</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git status'</strong> is a command that shows the current state of your working directory, providing information about any changes made to files since the last commit. It displays which files have been modified, added, or deleted, and which files are staged and ready for committing. It also indicates the current branch you are working on.</p>

      <h2>Add files to the staging area</h2>
      <h3>Stage single file:</h3>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git add file_name.ext</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git add'</strong> is a command that stages the specified file, `file_name.ext`, for commit in your Git repository. Staging a file means adding it to the staging area, which is a temporary area that holds the changes you want to include in the next commit. The command tells Git to track the current state of the file and prepare it for inclusion in the upcoming commit.</p>

      <h3>Stage all files in the directory:</h3>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git add .</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git add .'</strong> is a command that stages all the changes (new, modified, and deleted files) in the current directory and its subdirectories for the next commit. By staging changes, you're telling Git which files and changes should be included in the upcoming commit.</p>

      <h2>Commit changes to the repository</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git commit -m "Your commit message here"</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git commit -m'</strong> is a Git command used to save changes made to your project files in the local repository. The `-m` flag is followed by a commit message, which is a brief description of the changes you've made. This message helps you and others understand the purpose of each commit in the project's history.</p>

      <h2>Connect your local repository to a remote repository</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git remote add origin'</strong> is a command that creates a new remote connection named "origin" to a remote repository. The remote connection allows you to push, pull, and synchronize your local repository with the remote one. By convention, "origin" is the default name given to the primary remote repository, but you can use a different name if you prefer.</p>

      <h2>Push your changes to the remote repository</h2>
      <h3>Push a specific branch:</h3>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git push origin branch_name</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git push origin'</strong> is a command that pushes your local commits on the specified branch (`branch_name`) to the remote repository (`origin`). This updates the remote branch with your latest changes and synchronizes it with your local branch.</p>

      <h3>Push the master branch:</h3>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git push origin master</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git push origin master'</strong> is a command that pushes the committed changes from your local Git repository's `master` branch to the remote repository named `origin`. In other words, it uploads your local commits to the remote repository so that others can access the changes, and the remote repository is synchronized with your local repository's `master` branch.</p>

      <h2>Pull changes from the remote repository</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git pull origin branch_name</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git pull origin'</strong> is a command that fetches changes from a remote repository's specified branch (`branch_name`) and merges them into your local branch. It is a combination of two commands: `git fetch`, which retrieves the changes from the remote repository, and `git merge`, which integrates those changes into your local branch. In this command, `origin` refers to the remote repository from which you want to fetch the changes.</p>

      <h2>Create a new branch and switch to it</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git checkout -b new_branch_name</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git checkout -b'</strong>  creates a new branch named `new_branch_name`, which is based on the current branch you're on. Then, it immediately switches your working directory to this newly created branch. This allows you to start making changes and committing them to the new branch without affecting the original branch.</p>

      <h2>Switch to an existing branch</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git checkout branch_name</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git checkout'</strong> is a Git command that switches your working directory to the specified branch, updating the files in your project folder to match the latest commit on that branch. This allows you to work on different branches of your repository without affecting the main branch or other branches.</p>

      <h2>Merge changes from one branch into another</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git merge source_branch_name</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git merge'</strong> is a command that integrates changes from the specified `source_branch_name` into the currently checked-out branch. It compares the two branches, identifies the differences, and merges the changes from the source branch into the current branch, creating a new commit if there are no conflicts. If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually before the merge can be completed.</p>

      <h2>Delete a local branch</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git branch -d branch_name</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git branch -d'</strong> is a command used to delete a local branch ('branch_name') in a Git repository. It removes the specified branch only if it has been merged into the current or another branch. If the branch contains unmerged changes, the command will not delete it to prevent accidental data loss. To force delete a branch with unmerged changes, use the `-D` flag instead: `git branch -D branch_name`.</p>

      <h2>View commit history</h2>
      <pre><code class="code-block">git log</code></pre>
      <p><strong>'git log'</strong> is a command that displays the commit history of a Git repository. It shows a list of commits in reverse chronological order, providing information such as the commit author, date, and the commit message for each commit. This command helps you understand the changes made to the repository over time and navigate through its history.</p>

      <p>
        These are just a few basic Git commands to get you started. There are
        many more commands and options you can use to manage your Git
        repositories.
